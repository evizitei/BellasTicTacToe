# Bella's TicTacToe: A Foray into Javascript for a 4 year old

`TicTacToe` is a simple javascript game build with learning in mind. Essentially
rather than playing games with my daughter, we build games together.

This one is built as a javascript app on the client side, and all the
meat is in "TicTacToe.js".  If you clone the app as-is, you
can run it with "node bin/http-server" from the root directory.
This will get it up and running on port 8080.

Currently can be played with live at http://bellas-tic_tac_toe.nodejitsu.com/
